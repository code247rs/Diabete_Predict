# Diabetes Prediction GUI Application

This project is a machine learning-based GUI application that predicts the diabetes status of a patient 
using clinical and demographic data. The user inputs values such as age, gender, urea, cholesterol, and others 
into a graphical interface, and the app predicts whether the patient is:
- Non-Diabetic (0)
- Pre-Diabetic (1)
- Diabetic (2)

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:
```
python gui_app.py
```

Make sure the following files are in the same directory:
- `train_model.py` (used to generate and save the model)
- `scaler.joblib` and `diabetes_model.joblib` (generated by training)
- `gui_app.py` (the application interface)

## Dataset

The dataset used contains medical records for 1000 patients including:
- AGE, Gender, Urea, Cr, HbA1c, Chol, TG, HDL, LDL, VLDL, BMI
- CLASS (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Pre-Diabetic, 2 = Diabetic)

It is preprocessed and scaled before model training.

## Files

- `preprocess.py`: Cleans and standardizes the dataset
- `train_model.py`: Trains the classifier and saves model and scaler
- `gui_app.py`: GUI interface for user input and predictions
